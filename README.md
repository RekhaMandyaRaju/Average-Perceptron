Part I 

Execution of Perceptron

  To learn from training file execute following command
 
    python3 perceplearn.py TRAININGFILE MODELFILE
 
  To classify the TEST_DATA taken from STDIN execute the following command
   
    cat TEST_DATA | python3 percepclassify.py MODELFILE
    
    where MODELFILE is the modelfile generated by perceplearn.py
    
Part II     
 
POS TAGGING
 
 To learn from training file execute following command
 
    python3 postrain.py TRAININGFILE MODEL
    
 where postrain calls perceplearn.py through system call to obtain the MODEL file
 
 To classify the TEST_DATA taken from STDIN execute the following command
   
    cat TEST_DATA | python3 postag.py MODELFILE
    
 where MODELFILE is the modelfile generated by postrain.py
 
Part III

NER TAGGING

  To learn from training file execute following command
 
    python3 netrain.py TRAININGFILE MODEL
    
 where netrain calls perceplearn.py through system call to obtain the MODEL file
 
 To classify the TEST_DATA taken from STDIN execute the following command
   
    cat TEST_DATA | python3 netag.py MODELFILE
    
 where MODELFILE is the modelfile generated by netrain.py

 C)When Naive Baye's Classifier is used instead of Perceptron
  
  POS_TAGGING when Naive Baye's Classifier IS USED
    ACCURACY   - 0.9025680025330689 
   
  POS_TAGGING WHEN PERCEPTRON IS USED
   ACCURACY    - 0.94018560123701
   
   There is decrease in performance metrics of POS tagging when Naive Baye's classifier is used for classification. The performance of perceptron is  high when compared to Naive Baye's classifier. This is because of the mentioned below reasons:
   
   *Naive Baye's classifier uses Probablistic determination method whereas Perceptron uses discriminative method while learning training data.
   *There is only one iteration in Naive Baye's classifier where as Perceptron uses multiple iterations till the maximum weight  is obtained
   *Naive Baye's classifier do not update on mistakes where as Perceptron updates the weight when mistake is made.
   *Naive Baye's classifier considers bag of word features whereas Perceptron may use the context of the word.
